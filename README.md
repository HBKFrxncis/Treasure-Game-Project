# Treasure-Game-Project
This is a mini Treasure Game Project I made for a University Assignment Submission in 2nd Year
//
This project presents a grid-based treasure hunt game, where players compete to find hidden
treasure while avoiding traps and collecting power-ups. The game incorporates Artificial
Intelligence (AI) search algorithms such as Binary Search (BS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and
Depth-First Search (DFS) to enhance strategic decision-making.
The objective of this project is to create an engaging turn-based game that integrates
pathfinding algorithms, randomised gameplay elements, and player health management. This
report details the design process, challenges encountered, implemented solutions, and the role
of search algorithms in improving the game’s mechanics.
In my project, I demonstrate proficiency in Python programming, algorithmic problem-solving,
and game development concepts such as grid-based movement, AI-based decision-making,
and structured game state management.
## Project Overview
# Game Concept
The Treasure Hunt Game is a turn-based strategy game I developed, set on a randomly
generated grid-based map where players navigate in search of hidden treasure while avoiding
traps and obstacles. Each game session presents a unique layout, making every playthrough
unpredictable and requiring strategic thinking. Players can move manually or utilise AI-based
search algorithms—Binary Search to narrow down potential treasure locations, Breadth-First
Search to find the shortest and safest path, and Depth-First Search to explore alternative routes
when obstacles arise. Health management plays a crucial role, as stepping on traps reduces
health, and reaching zero results in elimination, while power-ups provide either health
restoration or hints about the treasure’s location. The turn-based mechanics ensure that each
player moves individually, updating the grid state and maintaining fairness. By integrating
randomised elements, structured gameplay mechanics, and algorithmic decision-making, I
aimed to create an engaging and dynamic experience that challenges players to think
strategically while competing to reach the treasure first.
# My Games Features
▪ Grid-based movement (Players move in four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right).
▪ Turn-based gameplay (Players take turns to move).
▪ Health tracking (Players lose health when stepping on traps; power-ups restore health).
▪ Search algorithms for treasure hunting (BS, BFS, DFS).
▪ Randomized grid elements (Every game session is unique).
